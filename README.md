<p> is nothing compared to all that are designed  every day around us ( "smart homes" , various applications, rapid communications, ideas that come out daily). The collection of information for the subject help us to “enter” in operating-material knowledge, how becomes the cummunication between them, design methodology and ways of connecting. More specifically, the material consists of the ARDUINO platform together with the shield that can be used (Ethernet shield), relays (relay), transistors, wires, electrical appliances. The function consists of the tools that we will study and will need (ANDROID STUDIO, IDE). The design and methodology has to do with the way you communicate will connect all this together and the desired result is the achievement of the project describing the subject.

<hr> <h4>Arduino UNO (hardware)</h4>
<p>Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.. You can tinker with your Uno without worrying too much about doing something wrong, worst case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again. "Uno" means one in Italian and was chosen to mark the release of Arduino Software (IDE) 1.0. The Uno board and version 1.0 of Arduino Software (IDE) were the reference versions of Arduino, now evolved to newer releases. The Uno board is the first in a series of USB Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform; for an extensive list of current, past or outdated boards see the Arduino index of boards.

<hr><h4>Arduino Ethernet Shield (hardware)</h4>
<p>The Arduino Ethernet Shield 2 connects your Arduino to the internet in mere minutes. Just plug this module onto your Arduino Board, connect it to your network with an RJ45 cable (not included) and follow a few simple steps to start controlling your world through the internet. As always with Arduino, every element of the platform – hardware, software and documentation – is freely available and open-source. This means you can learn exactly how it's made and use its design as the starting point for your own circuits. Hundreds of thousands of Arduino Boards are already fueling people’s creativity all over the world, everyday. Join us now, Arduino is you!

<hr><h4>Arduino IDE (software)</h4>
<p>The arduino platform split terminals, ports during requirements act as inputs as outputs. The use of applications during applications, supplements in time, details, IDE, we have to do it and do it on the screen. The Arduino platform is analyzed in the same way, using the usb port and using its prayer, we make downloads on the screen.
